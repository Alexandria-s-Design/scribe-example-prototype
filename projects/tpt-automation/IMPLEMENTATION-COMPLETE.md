**Factory Pattern**: Create presentation objects
**Template Method**: Consistent slide structure
**Strategy Pattern**: Different activity types
**Builder Pattern**: Construct complex PowerPoint objects

### Code Organization

```python
# High-level structure
TOPICS = {...}                           # Data layer
create_choice_board(topic, activities)  # Presentation layer
generate_all_choice_boards()            # Orchestration layer
```

### Dependencies

```
python-pptx==0.6.21  # PowerPoint generation
```

No external API calls, no cloud dependencies, fully local generation.
