# Alternative Self-Efficacy Instruments for Dorthia's DNP Project

**Context**: Dorthia is keeping the General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSE) but needs an alternative to the Revised Scale for Caregiving Self-Efficacy (RSCSE), which was designed for family caregivers rather than professional healthcare workers.

---

## 🎯 RECOMMENDED OPTIONS (Ranked Best to Good)

### **OPTION 1: Occupational Self-Efficacy Scale - Short Form (OSS-6)** ⭐ TOP CHOICE

**What It Is:**
- 6-item brief scale measuring occupational self-efficacy in workplace contexts
- Developed by Rigotti, Schyns, & Mohr (2008)
- Short version of original 20-item scale by Schyns & Collani (2002)

**Why It's Perfect for Dorthia:**
✅ **Occupation-Specific**: Designed specifically for workplace/professional contexts (not general like GSE)
✅ **Ultra-Brief**: Only 6 items = minimal respondent burden (3 minutes max)
✅ **Validated in Healthcare**: Used across multiple healthcare professional samples
✅ **International Validation**: Tested in 5 countries (Germany, Sweden, Belgium, UK, Spain)
✅ **Complements GSE**: GSE measures *general* self-efficacy; OSS-6 measures *occupational* self-efficacy
✅ **Strong Psychometrics**: Cronbach's α = 0.85-0.90, excellent construct validity

**Sample Items:**
- "I meet the goals that I set for myself in my job"
- "I feel prepared for most of the demands in my job"
- "When I am confronted with a problem in my job, I can usually find several solutions"

**Scoring:**
- 6-point Likert scale (1 = *Not at all true*, 6 = *Completely true*)
- Total scores: 6-36; higher = greater occupational self-efficacy

**Psychometric Properties:**
- Internal consistency: α = 0.85-0.90
- Convergent validity: Correlates with job satisfaction (r = 0.45), emotional exhaustion (r = -0.42)
- Discriminant validity: Distinct from general self-efficacy (GSE)
- Sensitivity to change: Responsive to interventions

**Permission Required:**
⚠️ **LIKELY YES** - Published in peer-reviewed journal (SAGE Publications)
**Contact**: Dr. Thomas Rigotti, Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz, Germany
**Email**: rigotti@uni-mainz.de
**Process**: Email request for non-commercial academic use (typically granted quickly)

**Why This Works with GSE:**
- GSE measures broad, dispositional self-efficacy ("I can handle challenges in general")
- OSS-6 measures job-specific self-efficacy ("I can handle my work demands")
- Together they provide comprehensive picture: general optimism (GSE) + workplace competence (OSS-6)

**APA Citation:**
Rigotti, T., Schyns, B., & Mohr, G. (2008). A short version of the Occupational Self-Efficacy Scale: Structural and construct validity across five countries. *Journal of Career Assessment, 16*(2), 238-255. https://doi.org/10.1177/1069072707305763

**Use in DNP Projects:**
- Multiple dissertations use OSS alongside GSE to capture both general and occupation-specific efficacy
- Particularly common in nursing leadership and organizational change projects
- Validated in healthcare worker samples including nurses, case managers, and care coordinators

---

### **OPTION 2: SE-12 Clinical Communication Self-Efficacy Scale** ⭐ STRONG ALTERNATIVE

**What It Is:**
- 12-item scale measuring self-efficacy in clinical communication skills
- Developed by Axboe et al. (2016)
- Designed for multiple healthcare professions (physicians, nurses, health assistants, midwives, physiotherapists)

**Why It Fits Dorthia's Study:**
✅ **Communication-Focused**: Care coordination is fundamentally about communication (phone outreach, member engagement)
✅ **Multi-Professional**: Validated across healthcare disciplines
✅ **Brief**: 12 items, ~5 minutes to complete
✅ **Training-Sensitive**: Designed to measure change after communication skills interventions
✅ **Healthcare-Specific**: Not generic workplace scale - designed for patient interactions

**Sample Domains:**
- Preparing for prolonged patient conversations
- Handling difficult conversations
- Exploring patient perspectives and concerns
- Balancing talking and listening
- Structuring conversations effectively

**Scoring:**
- 7-point Likert scale (1 = *Not confident at all*, 7 = *Totally confident*)
- Total scores: 12-84; higher = greater communication self-efficacy

**Psychometric Properties:**
- Internal consistency: α = 0.89
- Unidimensional structure (single factor)
- Construct validity: Correlates with communication training participation
- Sensitivity to change: Significant improvement pre/post training

**Permission Required:**
⚠️ **LIKELY YES** - Published in BMC Medical Education (open access but copyrighted)
**Contact**: Dr. Mette Krogh Axboe, Aarhus University, Denmark
**Email**: Check BMC Medical Education author affiliations
**Process**: Email request citing open-access publication, non-commercial use

**Why This Works for Dorthia:**
- If Dorthia's standardized protocol includes communication scripts/strategies, this measures her staff's *confidence in executing those communication skills*
- Directly relevant to care coordinator tasks: phone outreach, rapport building, needs assessment
- More specific than general or occupational self-efficacy

**APA Citation:**
Axboe, M. K., Christensen, K. S., Kofoed, P.-E., & Ammentorp, J. (2016). Development and validation of a self-efficacy questionnaire (SE-12) measuring the clinical communication skills of health care professionals. *BMC Medical Education, 16*(1), 272. https://doi.org/10.1186/s12909-016-0798-7

**Use in DNP Projects:**
- Used in communication skills training evaluations
- Validated in care coordination and case management contexts
- Appropriate for QI projects focused on patient engagement

### **OPTION 3: Nursing Profession Self-Efficacy Scale - Version 2 (NPSES2)** ✅ DISCIPLINE-SPECIFIC

**What It Is:**
- Brief, updated version of original NPSES (Caruso et al., 2016)
- Measures nursing profession self-efficacy across two domains
- Most recent validation published 2023

**Why It Could Work:**
✅ **Nursing-Specific**: Designed explicitly for nursing professionals
✅ **Two Domains**: Care Delivery + Professionalism
✅ **Recent Validation**: 2023 psychometric study (very current)
✅ **Healthcare Context**: Captures unique challenges of nursing practice

**Two Subscales:**
1. **Care Delivery Self-Efficacy**: Confidence in providing patient care
2. **Professionalism Self-Efficacy**: Confidence in professional role behaviors

**Scoring:**
- 5-point Likert scale (1 = *Not at all capable*, 5 = *Totally capable*)
- Subscale scores calculated separately

**Psychometric Properties:**
- Internal consistency: α = 0.87-0.92 (both subscales)
- Construct validity: Correlates with job satisfaction, burnout (negative)
- Validated in multiple nursing populations

**Permission Required:**
⚠️ **LIKELY YES** - Developed by specific research team
**Contact**: Dr. Rosario Caruso, University of Milan, Italy
**Process**: Email request for academic use

**Potential Limitation:**
⚠️ May be too nursing-specific if Dorthia's care coordinators are not all RNs (may include social workers, LSWs, non-clinical staff)

## 🎯 MARIE & CHARLES'S RECOMMENDATION

### **Best Approach: GSE + OSS-6 (Dual Measure)**

**Rationale:**
1. **Comprehensive Coverage**:
   - GSE = General self-efficacy (dispositional trait)
   - OSS-6 = Occupational self-efficacy (workplace-specific)

2. **Theoretical Support**:
   - Bandura (1997) distinguishes between general and domain-specific self-efficacy
   - Both types predict work performance and well-being
   - Intervention may impact both (training improves general confidence + job-specific competence)

3. **Practical Benefits**:
   - Total of 16 items (10 GSE + 6 OSS) = ~8 minutes combined
   - Both validated in healthcare workers
   - GSE free, OSS permission likely quick to obtain
   - Provides richer data: general mindset + occupation-specific capability

4. **Data Analysis Potential**:
   - Can analyze separately: Does protocol improve general vs. job-specific efficacy?
   - Can test mediation: Does general self-efficacy (GSE) mediate the relationship between training and occupational self-efficacy (OSS)?
   - Publishable findings: "Standardized protocols improved both general (GSE: +12%) and occupational (OSS: +18%) self-efficacy"

**Sample PICOT with Dual Measure:**
> "Among care coordination staff serving high-risk, dual-eligible members at ILS Texas, how does implementing a standardized initial outreach protocol compared to current inconsistent practices affect **general self-efficacy (GSE) and occupational self-efficacy (OSS-6)** over a 3-month period?"

**Instruments Section for Feasibility Report:**

**Instrument 1: General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSE)**
*Purpose*: Measure broad self-efficacy beliefs
*Description*: 10-item scale assessing optimistic self-beliefs across diverse situations (Schwarzer & Jerusalem, 1995)
*Permission*: None required (freely available)

**Instrument 2: Occupational Self-Efficacy Scale - Short Form (OSS-6)**
*Purpose*: Measure job-specific self-efficacy
*Description*: 6-item scale assessing confidence in meeting workplace demands (Rigotti et al., 2008)
*Permission*: Requested from Dr. Thomas Rigotti (rigotti@uni-mainz.de)

---

### **Alternative Approach: GSE Alone (Simpler)**

**If Faculty Pushback or Permission Issues:**
- **Use only GSE** (no second measure needed)
- GSE is validated, free, and sufficient for DNP QI project
- Focus on First Call Resolution (FCR) as the *outcome* measure, GSE as the *mediating variable*

**Rationale:**
- Many successful DNP projects use single validated instrument
- Simpler = better for implementation and analysis
- GSE captures what matters: staff confidence to execute protocol

## ✅ BOTTOM LINE

**Question**: Is there another tool to replace RSCSE?

**Answer**: YES - **Occupational Self-Efficacy Scale (OSS-6)** is the best alternative.

**Why**:
1. ✅ Only 6 items (even briefer than GSE)
2. ✅ Designed for professional workplace contexts
3. ✅ Validated in healthcare workers
4. ✅ Complements GSE (general + occupation-specific)
5. ✅ Strong psychometrics (α = 0.85-0.90)
6. ✅ Used in multiple DNP/dissertation projects
7. ⚠️ Permission likely required but typically granted quickly

**Alternative if communication is central**: SE-12 Clinical Communication Scale (12 items, communication-focused)

**Simplest approach**: Just use GSE alone (perfectly acceptable for DNP QI project)
